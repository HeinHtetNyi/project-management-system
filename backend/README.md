## Hibiya-sen: the Project Estimation System
Welcome! This is a technical screening assignment for Reimei Fujii from EngineerForce.
Please fork the repository [Hibiya-sen](https://shibuya.engineerforce.io/external/hibiya-sen) and open a new feature branch for your implementation.

Hibiya-sen is a simple Project Estimation System. We have designed a few fields for a Project object. Now, given a user story *“as a PM I want to create a new project with its project name and project start date”*, please implement it.


Please keep in mind that,
* Implement it in a RESTful API manner, or at least as much as possible.
* Do not take django admin implementation for any data entry.
* Implement modify/delete functionality for projects.
* Implement create/modify/delete nested tasks of a project.
* Implement at least two object permissions between users and projects.
* Give a brief description of how you implemented it and how we can run it in your README.md.
* We expect you to submit this assignment within a week and we would like to suggest that your actual working hours not exceed 8 hours a day.


Note:
* Please use only the default SQLite database so that we can replicate your environment easily.
* You can use as many python libraries as you want, and please keep `requirements.txt` update-to-date and commit to git.
* You can use as many node.js packages or none if you don’t want to. 

Bonus:
* Use `ReactJS`
* You can use Webpack, Vite or CRA.
* You can use Redux (preferred) or any kind of state manager
* You can use Material-UI (v5 or v4)
* Please consider user friendliness, design pattern
* Other convincible features


Your submission shall include the following in your repository:
- A README.md on how to set up your project, what features it has, and anything you want us to know about.
- [MUST] requirements.txt that lists python libraries that your project depends on.
- [Optional] packages.json if you use any kind of package management tool for frontend implementation.
- Your code of implementation.

Feel free to [approach us](mailto://minmin@engineerforce.io) if there is any question.
